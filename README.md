# **Asynchronous SRAM & Synchronous Controller – Verilog Implementation**

This project, completed as the final assignment for the *Digital Systems Design* course at **Sharif University of Technology**, implements an **asynchronous SRAM module** and a **synchronous memory controller**, inspired by the architecture and behavior of the **IS61LV25616AL** SRAM chip from **ISSI**.  
The design is fully written in **Verilog** and verified through **ModelSim** simulations, focusing on correct timing behavior, clean read/write cycles, and reliable controller–memory interaction. The work includes an **FSM-based controller**, **generalized memory structure**, and **comprehensive testbenches** for functional validation.
